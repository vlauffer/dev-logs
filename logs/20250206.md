 sat down in front of dungeon crab today all of the cards are still out from my previous play through and I've drawn a graph on a piece of paper with one axis labeled hard and easy and the other axis is labeled luck versus deterministic. And it'sâ€¦ Well, I thought I would find some sort of pattern or quadrant or region of games that I prefer to play with in the space, but games at all opposite ends of the spectrum seem to be fun for one reason or another for example, chess is a deterministic hard game. Puzzles are deterministic and easy. Craps is lucky and easy and then you could have a game like poker where it's a little more on the Luxx side but the tiniest bit deterministic and it's also hard. There's a lot of other examples here, but my main conclusion was that different games are fun for different reasons.

So where does that leave us on this current project? this may end up being just me rambling. But maybe what makes the games in the very different regions of this graph fun, has to do with brain power. A puzzle is a game in a sense, but instead of expanding your brain power it focuses mostly on object recognition which is a skill check that doesn't require a lot of thought. The satisfaction then has to do with the moment to moment aha moments and the gradually inevitable success of the endeavor. Chess on the other hand requires a lot of brain power and the satisfaction is more long-term?

To be honest, that doesn't make a lot of sense what I'm finding is that both chess and puzzles have these smaller satisfactions that eventually lead up to a larger thing. Speaking more specifically about modern board games, a game like pandemic, has the smaller satisfaction of removing cubes and then the larger satisfaction of curing diseases.

The main point I'm trying to illustrate right now is that your game can't just feel good at the end. every single term should feel good in someway. Maybe good isn't the right word maybe it's more about autonomy and agency. Redefining agency here as it was defined in that one doom to GDC talk, agency is wanting to take a specific action to achieve a goal, and being able to see the consequences of that action. The key thing there is wanting to take action. Players only want to take action when they understand what their goal is and what strategies may help lead them to victory.

so once again, what does this mean for dungeon crab? The thing that I've noticed so far is that the game isn't really fun on my turn. Cards are due interact with one another, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of strategy at the moment. The conditions under which I lose, don't feel known enough... where is the strategy?

After thinking about some of this stuff, I decided to take a step back from dungeon crab, and try to make some simple game using a normal deck of cards. I felt like an absolute waste of space for around 30 minutes while I was trying to make a card gamethat was fun. I tried to make blackjack, but you're able to discard a card in order to look at the next couple of cards and I couldn't really figure out how to make that fun. I also played normal blackjack and was surprised to see that, it's not really that fun without money involved. I then decided to straight up steel from a mobile game that I've liked in the past and kind of tried to emulate that, but it was hard because there's a lot of special cards in that game and stuff like that but through trying to replicate that game, I did actually find something I would consider enjoyable at least more enjoyable than the current state of dungeon crab

The game I made today is called 3 x 5 x 5. to set up the game take out a red and black card that has a number on it, and set aside the rest of the cards. You should now have a deck of 20 cards. Place three of the cards side-by-side in a row on the top. Your goal is to add up cards that get as close to each number as possible. Deal five cards to yourself if the card on top is red then adding red cards under it will get you closer to the number from zero and add adding black cards to the stack will decrease the number each stack can only have five cards.

I haven't explained it well and I'm tired, but I actually played a few rounds of this game today and had a fun time with it. It seems like solitaire although I still haven't learned how to play that yet so maybe I'll try that tomorrow.

What this game taught me about dungeon crab is that there needs to be a moment to moment action that the players can do and understand how it affects their future goals. In this game, I always felt like I could strategize a little bit and pairing up the numbers does feel kind of good. So yeah I need to strip away a bunch of dungeon crab until there's something here that feels good to play on a moment to moment basis. Maybe good isn't the right word but stimulating.

I also spent a few hours on programming stuff. I went through and created the schemas for game object related tables. I'm a little stuck right now on how we should be storing fields if they're all different types. For example, I have this field and it can be text or choice based. Does that mean I include a text field and a choice column in the row even though all text fields will not have a value for that choice column? I don't know what the right answer is, but I'm tired of thinking about it so I just went with yes

I also looked more into game development stuff. I have a vision of a game where you play music with your keyboard liked in the videos I used to make, but it's a little bit more like guitar hero. I tried to find similar games online and nothing really came up. I thought that was interesting but then I looked at some games that I did find that were similar and they were fun because they were simple. The game in my head would be so unapproachable but at the same time it could be fun to work on . I still want to make that sort of sound plant copy, and maybe there's a chance that I could build the software in a game.
