[Watched this video: How to make money designing board games - Jamey Stegmaier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rixlISRCi4w) and the wingspan guy said that he had a fulltime job while designing his first big games. Makes sense

Since DC was a complex mess of mechanics, I am looking into choosing one of its mechanics and making a game of that. What I was thinking of today was a coop card game where each player is a member of a single medival ruler's cabinet. The mechanic I'm trying to focus on is that of relationships between cards in the game. For example, in 1 game 2 different kingdoms could start at war, and in the next they could be trade partners.

The actual mechanisms by which this would be fun aren't clear to me yet, but was thinking something like this:

- Goal of game is to either take over or befriend the other kingdoms
- Each kingdom needs resources to survive
- Each kingdom has a surplus or deficit of resources
- Each kingdom has biases for or against working with another kingdom
- Trade keeps kingdom running
- War is another way to get resources

Actual components:
- Player's ruler / kingdom
- Player cards
- NPC ruler / kingdom cards
- Resource cards
- Desire cards
- War cards


OR 

- Goal of game is to be the last kingdom standing amist the apocalpyse 


Also decided on structure of web architecture fo BGTK. Just need to actually build it now...
