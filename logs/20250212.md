Didn't get anything done today or yesterday. Been playing a lot of games, justifying it by saying I'm gathering ideas, but mostly just having fun. It may be good in the end, because I think the biggest issue with my ideas for board games right now is that there's just no fun yet. 

Working on BGTK will make everything easier, so just need to keep at it
