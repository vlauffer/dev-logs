Didn't get anything done today or yesterday. Been playing a lot of games, justifying it by saying I'm gathering ideas, but mostly just having fun. It may be good in the end, because I think the biggest issue with my ideas for board games right now is that there's just no fun yet. 

Been cycling through Elden Ring, Rogue Trader, and Spider-Man. What makes Elden Ring great is the challenging combat (spent the last 4 days on parry-only Malenia fight). My favorite part about Rogue Trader so far is that exteremly big decisions are left up to the player, and they significantly effeect the game. For example, in the 1st act you have 3 locations to visit. Depending on which one you visit first, the others will be in a more tumultous state once you arrive there later. Spider Man is just good fun. Story is pretty standard "Look at all these bad guys" type plot, but the movement and combat are very good at player expression.

Working on BGTK will make everything easier, so just need to keep at it
