Playtested DC today with Noah. Made these changes:
- Main goal is to defeat the Hyperbeast, and you go through the dungeon in order to get better gear. You can challenge the Hyperbeast at any point
- You can discard another card in order to increase your modified stat for a test
- Shuffled in 3 cards into the dungeon deck that are evenly-ish spaced out. After a turn ends when one of these cards has been drawn, the party must decide if they are going to continue in the dungeon or face the Hyperbeast. If they want to keep going, they need to each discard one of their inventory cards. Otherwise, the dungeon deck is shuffled back in and the Hyperbeast joins the dungeon. (I like this concept cause its from breath of the wild)

Overview:
- I liked drawing 6 standard cards at the beginning and discarding 2, then allowing trade.
- Additional confusion over what to add when, and how the turn process works with dung. Need to include player turn instruction cards
- 12:20: "There's nothing here that I can really do" - Noah said this near the beginning. There was a dungeon card that causes damage in play, but it wasn't immeditaley clear to Noah what to prioritize. My main takeaway from this is that it should be easier to tell if a card is dangerous or not. Seems to indicate lulls in play. 
- 15:45 - Certain cards like the robot heart just don't do anything and stay on the table the entire game doing nothing. Need to find a more consistent use for cards a player doesn't actually need
- 16:30 What does Blockage actually mean?
- 20:20 - Noah actually said "I like this one a lot" about Cloudy Platypus. Novel card names / descriptions are a super important.
- 24:30 - Noah suggested that you can't put cards back into the dungeon to prevent people from using the dungeon as infinite storage. I think this is good because it means you need to make a concious decision on which cards you are going to pick up.
- 29:00 - "I don't feel like there's anything I can do here"
- 31:37 Hammer OP. Need to add a a test to it. Also should make it so failed tests still succeed a little.
- 36:50 - Bannana's Revenge enters play and for the first time, Noah said "we gotta get rid of this s%&@!" This indicates to me that Noah was excited to work through this challenge, so more moments like this could be good. Maybe include a separate deck of constant threats? Like a mini-monsters deck that is drawn from whenever another monster is defeated.
- 43:45 - Noah asks "how do I allyify", 
- 45:00 - around this point I started feeling like the momentum was fleeting. Offered Noah opporunity to skip ahead in game but he declined cause he's an NJB
- 48:45 - Need to define what "all cards" actually means. Something like this is easier if there is a limit to the amount of cards in the dunegon at a given time. However at this point we had around 10 cards in the dungeon, and dealing damagae to "all cards" would have been tedious.
- 54:30 - Noah allified the first time.
- 55:30 - realizing at this point that I am just using the spear each turn which isn't very interesting.
- 57:30 - Hyperbeast enters
- 1:04:30 - Decide to cut short because we were just stabbing the hyperbeast and at that point there weren't any more interesting decisions to make.
- 1:06:30 - Noah: "You need to fine tune the balance between luck and strategy"

Pros:
- Noah liked the names and card descriptions
- Noah liked the dungeon reactions as a mechanic because it afforded a decision the player needed to make. Seems 1-dimensional when there is only 1 threat to address --> more cards that are threats to players that are demanding their attention.
- Noah liked the allyify thing

Cons: 
- "It's a little luck of the draw" - I internalize this as there isn't much strategy / interesting decitions to make.
- Tracking tags and health
- "Didn't really use the modified. Passing a test seemed too easy most of the time"
- Not a lot of combat early
- Iron Hammer is OP


Takeaways
- ADD MORE THREAT
- Low skill ceiling?
- Sister Salant's text needs change for anarchy
- Can't activate after drawing a card raw
- Need to get rid of effects that increase or decrease stats via tokens. Cards are ok, but counting out a bunch of tokens for each increase or decrease sucks
- If player dies, maybe they just discard their hand?
- Look into post-turn damage to increase tension
- Noah preferred that all cards do not react on every turn end. 
- Could the game play better without tags?
- Hard to tell if its not amazing because of balance issues or issues with the mechanics
- More stat-specific effects? (If player has -1 INT, take 2 damage)
- Draw 3 dungeon cards before the players draw standard cards?

More on game metrics in slay the spire. Big takeaway was about using discord as a testing playground. They also had a ton of balance issues figured out before the game entered early access: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rqfbvnO_H0

Think about loss loss-aversion concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_1YcCcBVfY&t=2609s
Takeaways include that phrasing a loss as someone else's gain can be better. Instead of losing something, player could just not get something.
