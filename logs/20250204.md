Made this repo lol

Lied in bed for 2 hours and just thought about a bunch of stuff. Also decided to remake the playtest component for DC so I can make it work better and tokens + cards can share logic. 

Watched a video about playtesting board games and my main takeaway was that I should just focus on 1 mechanic of the game before working out others. Right now DC has:
- Inventory (hand size) management
- Tag influence
- NPC relationships
- Combat / Allyifying (ways of clearing beings)

Main issue right now is that it is devoid of a specific goal, and while the mechanics are interesting, they aren't in the context of a larger goal or fun yet. I should take a look at just 1 of the mechanics. Lets go with tags. AKA adding or removing tags in order to clear stuff. Should there just be cards with the tag names instead of tokens? That would definitely solve the thousand token issue. More on this tomorrow.

Orchest is having a show I could maybe perform in but I think that might be taking on too much. Need to keep focused on this game stuff.
