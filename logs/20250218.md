Had idea to modify the gameplay. The issue right now is that the moment to moment gameplay isnâ€™t that interesting. So something needs to change on a micro level before a macro one. Maybe instead of cards that represent equipment, the cards were essentially types of energy that could be used in order to execute powers associated with the player characters. For example the warrior class has an ability called true star strike that requires 5 red energy of max efficiency. If the warrior only has 5 green energy they can still use that power but it will do half damage. Thinking something about card combos with other players could be cool too.

Took a break from everything over the past few days and just played videos games. Started the Elden Ring DLC and it slaps. Finished the main story of Spider-Man and it really dropped in quality towards the end but I still liked it. Started black cat DLC and I just love their dynamic so much. I looked up if there are any spider man books that feature the 2 of them and there are Only comics. Maybe I could write one
