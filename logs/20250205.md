Thinking about adding a separate deck of standard cards that players draw from after every turn, and they discard these cards in order to play other cards from their hand? At the beginning of each turn they would draw up to 3 cards?

Also maybe player cards have 2 sides. 1 for starter level and then another for an upgraded version of the card that you achieve by doing a certain thing, like discard 3 relics.

[Think about opportunity costs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcyyeAww2wc&t=697s) Right now the game lacks interesting moment-to-moment decisions.

Adjaceny system seems interesting, but maybe too complicated at this point. Would solve the issue of things like grenades / AOE spells by saying "damage adjacent cards" where "adjacent" meants cards to the top, bottom, left and right of the card.

I set up the game so that you need to discard some cards in order to activate others but it still feels like it doesn't solve the main issue. What are the interesting or difficult or meaningful decisions? A player makes on their turn? Is the game too chaotic and easy?? When I lose the game right now I get a feeling of "well I don't know what could have prevented that "

I take this to mean that it's just a little too complicated right now and I need to strip away some mechanics until one thing is creating for meaningful decisions. Need to simplify so that there are clear trade-offs in decision-making.
