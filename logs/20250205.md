**DC:**
Thinking about adding a separate deck of standard cards that players draw from after every turn, and they discard these cards in order to play other cards from their hand? At the beginning of each turn they would draw up to 3 cards?

Also maybe player cards have 2 sides. 1 for starter level and then another for an upgraded version of the card that you achieve by doing a certain thing, like discard 3 relics.

[Think about opportunity costs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcyyeAww2wc&t=697s) Right DC the game lacks interesting moment-to-moment decisions.

Adjaceny system seems interesting, but maybe too complicated at this point. Would solve the issue of things like grenades / AOE spells by saying "damage adjacent cards" where "adjacent" meants cards to the top, bottom, left and right of the card.
