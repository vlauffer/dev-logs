**DC:**
Thinking about adding a separate deck of standard cards that players draw from after every turn, and they discard these cards in order to play other cards from their hand? At the beginning of each turn they would draw up to 3 cards?

Also maybe player cards have 2 sides. 1 for starter level and then another for an upgraded version of the card that you achieve by doing a certain thing, like discard 3 relics.
