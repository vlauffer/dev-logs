 Spent probably three hours trying to figure out how to make a menu pop-up on hover. Went through several different felt libraries and at the end of the day just ended up implementing it myself God I hate coding 

thinking through the designs for how game object collections categories, and then the actual game object should work. Right now it's really confusing me about how everything should be laid out and I need to draw some stuff out.
