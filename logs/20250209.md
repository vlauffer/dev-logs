I didn't work too much on this today, but started making the gameobject page. 

Haven't done much development on the game stuff. It's hard to work on something when you don't have the proper tools for it yet. I don't need much, but having this tool fully functioning would be a big help, and not having it means I would always be re-doing a bunch of work when I wanted to change big designs
